Some initial testing conclusions are:

For five atoms case:
1) Steady state seems to be reachable under external periodic driving
2) changing the amplitude and frequency do change the final current


For diatomic, things got a bit "strange", namely:
1) the interfacial current and internal current do not equal (maybe it is harder to reach SS?)



One interesting hypothesis I could give is:
The driving could make currents to both baths. That is,
currents flowing out from the system to both baths, 
instead of going from one bath to the other. 
Which means PUMPING!!


Also, the external drive can be seen as a modulator,
which tune the currents, even under the existing temperature bias.
Which is probably more true when adding the "periodic"
to the force terms, rather than displacement terms.
