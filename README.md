## Parallelization
Parallel Computing(PC) is one of the most crucial components of HPC (high performance computing). It has greatly boosted people's ability to do simulations on large systems and process huge amount of data.

## PC in *Python*

### Multithreading and Multiprocessing

### Message passing on *Cluster* based high performance computation

### Other "ways" around

#### Numba

#### Cython

## Scripts used in this project
single trajectory file with `Pool` class from `multiprocessing`, submission script to the Cluster Quene
